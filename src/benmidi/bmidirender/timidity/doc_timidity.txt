NAME
       TiMidity++ - MIDI-to-WAVE converter and player

SYNOPSIS
       timidity [options] filename [...]

DESCRIPTION
       TiMidity++  is  a converter that converts some of MIDI files (supported
       formats: Standard MIDI files (*.mid), Recomposer files  (*.rcp,  *.r36,
       *.g18,  *.g36)  and  Module  files  (*.mod)) into formatted audio files
       (e.g. RIFF WAVE).  TiMidity++ uses Gravis  Ultrasound-compatible  patch
       files  or Soundfonts (*.sfx, *.sf2) to generate digital audio data from
       MIDI files.  The digital audio data  generated  by  TiMidity++  can  be
       stored  in  a  file  for  processing, or played in real time through an
       audio device.
       In real time playing, TiMidity++ can show the lyrics contained  in  KAR
       or WRD files.

FILENAME
       You can use the following expressions as the filename argument:

       -      Read a MIDI file from standard input.

       path/filename
              Read a MIDI file from the specified path on a filesystem.

       dir:directory
       directory/
              Read  and  play  all MIDI files in the specified directory.  For
              example,

              % timidity some/where/

              plays all files in the directory some/where/.

       Archive File
              Extract and play the file(s) in the archive.   If  you  want  to
              specify  a certain MIDI file in the archive, append #<MIDI-file-
              name> to the archive name.  The path after `#' allows the use of
              the wildcard expressions (case insensitive).
              You  can  use escape sequence \xHH, where `HH' is a ASCII number
              in hexadecimal integer.

              For example:

              % timidity file.zip#file.mid
                     Plays file.mid in file.zip

              % timidity file.lzh#*.mid
                     Plays any files that match the wildcard expression  *.mid
                     in file.lzh

              % timidity file.tgz#*
                     This expression is the same as file.tgz

              Since  these  mechanism  are contained in TiMidity++ itself, you
              can use this syntax even in the MS Windows environment.

              TiMidity++ can handle the following archive formats:

              tar (*.tar)

              tar+gzip (*.tar.gz, *.tgz)

              zip (*.zip)

              lzh (*.lzh, *.lha)
                     (lh0, lh1, lh2, lh3, lh4, lh5, lh6, lz4, lzs and lz5  are
                     available)

              Other  archives can be expanded if expander command is specified
              on the compile phase.  TiMidity++ will pipe that command.

       news://news-server[:port]/Message-ID
       news://news-server[:port]/newsgroup[/first-last]
              Play the MIDI file in the specified article on the news  server.
              If  a  newsgroup  is  specified  TiMidity++ plays all MIDI files
              found in any article posted to that newsgroup.
              TiMidity++ parses MIME Multi-part messages in case  of  news://*
              scheme,  extracts  MIDI  file that was post to that group, or in
              case of normal file, you can explicitly handle MIME documents by
              naming that file with *.mime extension, or prefix that file with
              mime:

              The following MIME-types are allowed:

              uu-encoded file
                     begin
                     is required

              base64 encoded
                     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
                     is required

              quoted-string
                     Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-string
                     is required

              Mac BinHex format
                     only HQX format is available

       http://address
       ftp://address
              Play the file specified in the URL.

              For example:

              %              timidity              http://www.goice.co.jp/mem-
              ber/mo/dist/midi/impromptu.mid
                     plays the specified MIDI-file directly from the network.

              If  these  expression  are used in the *.cfg files, you can even
              use patch-files (and others) from remote machines.

INPUT FILE
       TiMidity++ can handle the following file formats:

       .mid, .rmi (Format 0, 1, 2)
              Standard MIDI File

       .rcp, .r36, .g18, .g36 (Recomposer formats)
              Recomposer format which is product for COME ON MUSIC co.

       .mfi (MFi Version 3 - Melody Format for i-Mode)
              i-Mode is Japanese local mobile phone

       .kar (Karaoke format)
              Displays the lyrics as a Lyric Meta Event message.

       .mod, mod.* (Module file)

       .wrd (WRD format)

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are accepted by TiMidity++:

       -A [n][,m](a)
       --amplification=n
       --drumpower=m
       --[no-]volume-compensation
              Multiplies the master volume  by  n%.   Default  value  is  70%.
              Higher  amplification  makes louder sounds.  You can specify the
              drum power, ratio of drum volume from the other  channels.   The
              allowed values of amplification range from 0 (no sound) to 800.
              Optionally  to put `a' character along with -a option, or to use
              --volume-compensation, instructs TiMidity++  to  regularize  the
              volume.  You can easily gain dynamic range.

              For example:

              -A90   volume 90%, drum power 100%, compensation is off

              -A,120 volume 70%, drum power 120%, compensation is off

              -A90,120
                     volume 90%, drum power 120%, compensation is off

              -Aa    volume 70%, drum power 100%, compensation is on

              -A90a  volume 90%, drum power 100%, compensation is on

              -A,120a
                     volume 70%, drum power 120%, compensation is on

              -A90,120a
                     volume 90%, drum power 120%, compensation is on

       -a, --[no-]anti-alias
              Turns  on anti-aliasing.  Samples are run through a lowpass fil-
              ter before playing, which reduces aliasing noise at  low  resam-
              pling frequencies.

       -B n,m, --buffer-fragments=n,m
              For the Linux/FreeBSD/OSS/ALSA/Windows sound driver, selects the
              number of buffer fragments in interactive mode.  Increasing  the
              number  of  fragments  may reduce choppiness when many processes
              are running.  It will make TiMidity++ seem to respond sluggishly
              to  fast forward, rewind, and volume controls, and it will throw
              the status display off sync.  Specify a fragments number of 0 to
              use the maximum number of fragments available.

       -C n, --control-ratio=n
              Sets the ratio of sampling and control frequencies.  This deter-
              mines how often envelopes are recalculated -- small ratios yield
              better quality but use more CPU time.

       -c file, --config-file=file
              Reads an extra configuration file.

       -D n, --drum-channel=n
              Marks  channel as a drum channel.  If channel is negative, chan-
              nel -n is marked as an instrumental channel.  If  n  is  0,  all
              channels are marked as instrumental.

       -d dir, --interface-path=dir
              Specifies the directory containing installed dynamic-link inter-
              face modules.

       -E mode, --ext=mode
              Set TiMidity++ extend modes.  The following modes are  available
              (capitalized switch means disable this feature):

              w/W, --[no-]mod-wheel
                     Enable/disable modulation controlling.

              p/P, --[no-]portamento
                     Enable/disable portamento controlling.

              v/V, --[no-]vibrato
                     Enable/disable NRPM vibration.

              s/S, --[no-]ch-pressure
                     Enable/disable channel pressure controlling.

              e/E, --[no-]mod-envelope
                     Enable/disable modulation envelope controlling.

              t/T, --[no-]trace-text-meta
                     Enable/disable tracing all Text Meta Events.

              o/O, --[no-]overlap-voice
                     Accept/reject pronouncing multiple same notes.

              z/Z, --[no-]temper-control
                     Enable/disable  MIDI Tuning Standard temperament control-
                     ling.

              mHH, --default-mid=HH
                     Sets the manufacturer ID to HH (where HH are two hex-dig-
                     its).
                     HH  values of GS/gs, XG/xg or GM/gm are understood as 41,
                     43 and 7e respectively.

              MHH, --system-mid=HH
                     Sets the system manufacturer ID to HH (where HH  are  two
                     hex-digits).
                     In  this  option, the manufacture ID is set unchangeable.
                     Manufacture ID from the input file would be ignored.

              bn, --default-bank=n
                     Use tone bank n as the default.

              Bn, --force-bank=n
                     Sets the bank number of all channels to n.

              in[/m], --default-program=n[/m]
                     Use the program number as the  default  instrument.   Any
                     Program  Change  events  in MIDI files will override this
                     option.
                     If n is followed by /m the default program number of  the
                     channel m is specified by n.

              In[/m], --force-program=n[/m]
                     Similar to -Ei but this ignores all program changes.

              F args For effects.  See below.  In args option, you can specify
                     following effect options:

                     delay=(d|l|r|b)[,msec], --delay=(d|l|r|b)[,msec]
                            Sets delay type.

                            d, 0   Disabled delay effect.

                            l, 1   Left delay.

                            r, 2   Right delay.

                            b, 3   Swap left & right.

                            Optional msec is the delay time.

                     chorus=(d|n|s)[,level], --chorus=(d|n|s)[,level]

                            d, 0   Disable this effect.

                            n, 1   Enable MIDI chorus effect control.

                            s, 2   Surround sound, chorus detuned to a  lesser
                                   degree (default).

                            The  optional parameter level specifies the chorus
                            level 0 to 127.

                     reverb=(d|n|g)[,level], --reverb=(d|n|g)[,level]

                     reverb=(f|G)[,level,scaleroom,offsetroom,predelay]

                     --reverb=(f|G)[,level,scaleroom,offsetroom,predelay]

                            d, 0   Disable MIDI reverb effect control.

                            n, 1   Enable MIDI reverb  effect  control.   This
                                   effect is only available in stereo.

                            g, 2   Global reverb effect.

                            f, 3   Freeverb   MIDI   reverb   effect   control
                                   (default).

                            G, 4   Global Freeverb effect.

                            The optional parameter level specifies the  reverb
                            level 0 to 127.
                            For  Freeverb effect, additional parameters scale-
                            room, offsetroom and predelay  can  be  specified.
                            scaleroom and offsetroom specify variables for the
                            room size calculated as
                            roomsize = C * scaleroom + offsetroom
                            where C is the reverberation character.   predelay
                            specifies  the factor for pre-delay time of rever-
                            beration in percent.  Any of the optional  parame-
                            ters can be omitted.  Default values are 0.28, 0.7
                            and 100 respectively.

                     vlpf=(d|c|m), --voice-lpf=(d|c|m)

                            d, 0   Disable LPF effect.

                            c, 1   Chamberlin    resonant    LPF    (12dB/oct)
                                   (default).

                            m, 2   Moog resonant low-pass VCF (24dB/oct)

                     ns=n, --noise-shaping=n
                            Enable  the  n th degree noiseshaping filter.  The
                            distortion at decay stage  is  improved,  but  the
                            noise  on human auditory feeling increases because
                            it shifts to a high frequency.  In case  of  8-bit
                            linear  encoding,  valid  values  of  n are in the
                            interval from 0 (min) to 4 (max).   Default  value
                            is  4.   In  case of 16-bit linear encoding, valid
                            values of n are in  the  interval  from  0  to  4.
                            According  to  the  value,  it works as following.
                            Default value is 4.

                            0      No noise shaping.

                            1      Traditional noise shaping.

                            2      Overdrive-like soft-clipping  +  new  noise
                                   shaping.

                            3      Tube-amplifier-like   soft-clipping  +  new
                                   noise shaping.

                            4      New noise shaping.

                     resamp=(d|l|c|L|n|g), --resample=(d|l|c|L|n|g)

                            d, 0   No interpolation.

                            l, 1   Linear interpolation.

                            c, 2   Cubic spline interpolation.

                            L, 3   Lagrange method.

                            n, 4   Newton polynomial interpolation.

                            g, 5   Modified Gauss effect (default).

                            This option affects the behavior of -N option.

       -e, --evil
              Make TiMidity++ evil.  For the Win32 version, this increases the
              task  priority  by  one.   It  can give better playback when you
              switch tasks at the expense of slowing all other tasks down.

       -F, --[no-]fast-panning
              Turns on fast panning to accommodate  MIDI  pieces  that  expect
              panning  adjustments  to  affect notes that are already playing.
              Some files that don't expect this have a habit of flipping  bal-
              ance rapidly between left and right, which can cause severe pop-
              ping when the -F flag is used.
              In the current version of TiMidity++ this option is a toggle.

       -f, --[no-]fast-decay
              Toggles fast envelopes.  This option makes TiMidity++ faster but
              the release time of the notes are shortened.

       -g sec, --spectrogram=sec
              Open  the Sound-Spectrogram window.  This option is activated if
              the system has support for the X Window System.

       -H n, --force-keysig=n
              Specify the number of key signature.   MIDI  file  is  performed
              with  transposition to the key of the number of sharp (when n is
              positive) or flat (when n is negative).  Valid values of  n  are
              in the interval from -7 to 7.  For example, if n is 1, MIDI file
              with any tonality will be performed transposing to 1 flat (i.e.,
              F major or D minor).  Therefore, it is convenient to use for the
              accompaniment when practicing a musical instrument by the tonal-
              ity which is easy to perform.

       -h, --help

       -i mode, --interface=mode
       --realtime-priority=n
       --sequencer-ports=n
              Selects  the  user interfaces from the compiled-in alternatives.
              mode must be begun with one of the supported  interface  identi-
              fiers.  Run TiMidity++ with the -h option to see a list.
              For  ALSA sequencer interface, optionally to use --realtime-pri-
              ority,  set  the  realtime   priority   by   n,   and   to   use
              --sequencer-ports,  set  the  number  of opened sequencer ports.
              Default value is 4.

              Interface options
                     Option characters may  be  added  immediately  after  the
                     interface  identifier.   The following options are recog-
                     nized:

                     v, --verbose=n
                            Increases verbosity level.  This option is cumula-
                            tive.

                     q, --quiet=n
                            Decreases verbosity level.  This option is cumula-
                            tive.

                     t, --[no-]trace
                            Toggles trace mode.   In  trace  mode,  TiMidity++
                            attempts  to  display  its  current  state in real
                            time.  For the Linux sound driver, this is  accom-
                            plished  through the use of short DMA buffer frag-
                            ments, which can be tuned via the -B option.

                     l, --[no-]loop
                            Loop playing (some interfaces ignore this option)

                     r, --[no-]random
                            Randomize file list arguments before playing

                     s, --[no-]sort
                            Sort file list arguments before playing

                     D, --[no-]background
                            Daemonize TiMidity++ in  background  (for  alsaseq
                            only)

       -j, --[no-]realtime-load
              Enable the loading of patch files during play.

       -K n, --adjust-key=n
              Adjusts key (i.e., transposes the song) by n half tones.  Ranges
              from -24 to 24.

       -k msec, --voice-queue=msec
              Specify audio queue time limit to reduce voices.  If the remain-
              ing  audio  buffer  is  less  than msec milliseconds, TiMidity++
              tries to kill some voices.  This feature makes  it  possible  to
              play  complicated MIDI files on slow CPUs.  Setting msec to zero
              tells TiMidity++ to never remove any voices.

       -L path, --patch-path=path
              Adds path to the library path.  Patch, configuration,  and  MIDI
              files are searched along this path.  Directories added last will
              be searched first.  Note that the current  directory  is  always
              searched first before the library path.

       -M name, --pcm-file=name
              TiMidity++  can  play  a  PCM  file  instead of a MIDI file.  If
              ``auto'' is specified, TiMidity++ tries to open  foo.mid.wav  or
              foo.mid.aiff  when  playing  foo.mid.  If ``none'' is specified,
              this feature is disabled.  Otherwise just plays name.

       -m msec, --decay-time=msec
              Modify envelope volume decay time.  msec is the  minimum  number
              of milliseconds to sustain a sustained note.

              -m0    Disable  sustain ramping, causes constant volume sustains
                     (default).

              -m1    Effectively behaves as if all sustains are ignored,  vol-
                     ume ramping is the same as normal stage 3.

              -m3000 A  note  at  full volume will decay for 3 seconds once it
                     begins to be sustained (assuming the regular stage 3 rate
                     would  not  cause it to decay even longer).  Softer notes
                     will of course die sooner.

       -N n, --interpolation=n
              Sets interpolation parameter.  This option depends on the -EFre-
              samp option's value.

              cspline, lagrange
                     Toggles 4-point linear interpolation (default is on).

              newton n  point  interpolation using Newton polynomials.  n must
                     be an odd number from 1 to 57.

              gauss  n+1 point modified Gauss interpolation.  Ranges  0  (dis-
                     able) to 34 (max), default to 25.

              In  either  way,  linear  interpolation is used if audio queue <
              99%.

       -O mode, --output-mode=mode
       --flac-verify
       --flac-padding=n

              Selects the output mode from the compiled-in alternatives.  mode
              must  begin  with  one of the supported output mode identifiers.
              Run TiMidity++ with the -h option to see the list.
              Special in Ogg FLAC output mode, verifying generated data  (will
              be  a bit slower), the size of header padding (default is 4096),
              the compression level (0 to 8)  (default  is  5),  and  enabling
              OggFLAC  stream  can  be specified by --flac-verify, --flac-pad-
              ding, --flac-complevel and --oggflac options respectively.

              10) (default is 8), Enabling VBR output, enabling ABR output and
              setting the ratio to n, enabling VAD (voice activity detection),
              enabling DTX (discontinuous transmission), the encoding complex-
              ity (0 to 10) (default is 3), and frames in a single Ogg  packet
              (0  to  10)  (default is 1) can be specified by --speex-quality,
              --speex-vbr, --speex-abr, --speex-vad, --speex-dtx, --speex-com-
              plexity and --speex-nframes options respectively.
              The following identifiers are available in all versions:

              -Od    Outputs via audio device (default)

              -Os    Output to ALSA

              -Or    Generate  raw waveform data.  All format options are sup-
                     ported.  Common formats include:

                     -OrU   u-Law

                     -Or1sl 16-bit signed linear PCM

                     -Or8ul 8-bit unsigned linear PCM

              -Ou    Generate Sun Audio (au) data

              -Oa    Generate AIFF data

              -Ow    Generate RIFF WAVE format output.  If output is  directed
                     to  a  non-seekable file, or if TiMidity++ is interrupted
                     before closing the file, the  file  header  will  contain
                     0xffffffff in the RIFF and data block length fields.  The
                     popular sound conversion utility sox is able to read such
                     malformed files, so you can pipe data directly to sox for
                     on-the-fly conversion to other formats.

                     Option characters may be added immediately after the mode
                     identifier  to  change  the output format.  The following
                     options are recognized:

                     S, --output-stereo
                            Stereo

                     M, --output-mono
                            Monophonic

                     s, --output-signed
                            Signed output

                     u, --output-unsigned
                            Unsigned output

                     1, --output-16bit
                            16-bit sample width

                     2, --output-24bit
                            24-bit sample width

                     8, --output-8bit
                            8-bit sample width

                     l, --output-linear
                            Linear encoding

                     U, --output-ulaw
                            u-Law (8-bit) encoding

                     A, --output-alaw
                            A-Law encoding

                     x, --[no-]output-swab
                            Byte-swapped output

                     Note that some options have no effect on some modes.  For
                     example,  you  cannot  generate  a byte-swapped RIFF WAVE
                     file, or force uLaw output on a Linux PCM device.

       -o file, --output-file=file
              Place output on file, which may be  a  file,  device,  or  HP-UX
              audio  server, depending on the output mode selected with the -O
              option.  The special filename `-' causes output to be placed  on
              stdout.

       -P file, --patch-file=file
              Use patch file for all programs.

       -p [n](a)
       --polyphony=n
       --[no-]polyphony-reduction
              Sets polyphony (maximum number of simultaneous voices) to n.
              Optionally  to put `a' character along with -p option, or to use
              --polyphony-reduction, instructs TiMidity++ to enable  automatic
              polyphony reduction algorithm.

       -Q n[,...](t)
       --mute=n[,...]
       --temper-mute=n[,...]
              Cause channel n to be quiet.  n can carry out package specifica-
              tion by `,'.  If n is 0, all channels are turned off.   Continu-
              ously, specifying -n, channel n is turned back on.
              On  the  other  hand, to put `t' character after -Q option or to
              use --temper-mute describes temperament mute.  This mutes  chan-
              nels  of specific temperament type n.  For preset temperament, n
              can range 0 to 3.  For user-defined temperament, n can  range  4
              to 7.

       -q sec/n, --audio-buffer=sec/n
              Specify  audio buffer in seconds.  sec maximum size of buffer, n
              percentage filled at the beginning (default is 5.0/100) (size of
              100% equals the whole device buffer size).

       -R msec
              Enables  Pseudo Reverb Mode.  It sets every instrument's release
              to msec ms.  If msec is 0, msec is set to 800 (default).

       -S n, --cache-size=n
              Sets the re-sample cache size to n bytes.  If  n  equals  0  any
              sample  caches  are disabled.  The default value of n is 2097152
              (2MB).

       -s freq, --sampling-freq=freq
              Sets the resampling  frequency  (Hz  or  kHz).   Not  all  sound
              devices  are  capable  of all frequencies -- an approximate fre-
              quency may be selected, depending on the implementation.

       -T n, --adjust-tempo=n
              Adjust tempo to n%; 120 play MOD files with an NTSC Amiga's tim-
              ing.

       -t code, --output-charset=code
              Sets  output  coding  of Japanese text.  Possible values of code
              are:

              auto   determined by the LANG environment variable.

              ascii  Translates non-ASCII code to period.

              nocnv  No conversion.

              1251   Convert from windows-1251 to koi8-r.

              euc    Outputs EUC (Japan) coding.

              jis    Outputs JIS coding.

              sjis   Outputs SJIS coding.

       -U, --[no-]unload-instruments
              Unload all instruments from memory between MIDI files.  This can
              reduce  memory  requirements  when playing many files in succes-
              sion.

       -V power, --volume-curve=power
              Set the power of volume curve.  The total amplification  becomes
              volume^power.    0  (default)  uses  the  regular  tables.   Any
              non-zero value causes all midi  to  use  the  new  user  defined
              velocity/volume/expression  curve (linear: 1, ideal: ~1.661, GS:
              ~2).

       -v, --version
              Show the version string

       -W mode, --wrd=mode
              Play WRD file.

              Allowed values of mode are:

              x      X Window System mode

              w      Windows console mode

              t      TTY mode

              d      Dumb mode (outputs WRD events directory)

              -      do not trace WRD

              R[opts]
                     Sets WRD options:

                     a1=b1,a2=b2,...
                            Sets the WRD options.  an is the  name  of  option
                            and bn is the value.

                     d=n    Emulates timing (@WAIT, @WMODE) bugs of the origi-
                            nal MIMPI player.  The emulation levels are:

                            -WRd=0 do not emulate any bugs of MIMPI

                            -WRd=1 only emulate some bugs (default)

                            -WRd=2 emulate all known bugs

                     F=file Use file as WRD file only no file  matching  *.wrd
                            is found.

                     f=file Uses file as WRD file.

              WRD mode must also use trace mode (option -i?t) or the timing of
              the WRD events will be terrible.

       -w mode, --rcpcv-dll=mode
              Extended mode for MS Windows.  The following options are  avail-
              able:

              -w r   Use rcpcv.dll to play RCP/R36 files.

              -w R   Do not use rcpcv.dll (default).

       -x str, --config-string=str
              Configure TiMidity++ with str.  The format of str is the same as
              timidity.cfg.

              For example:
              -x'bank 0\n0 violin.pat'
              Sets the instrument number 0 to violin.
              Character `\' (Ascii 0x5c) in the str is treated as escape char-
              acter like in C literals.  For example \n is treated as carriage
              return.

       -Z file, --freq-table=file
              Cause the table of frequencies to be read from  file.   This  is
              useful  to  define a tuning different from 12-equal temperament.
              If ``pure'' is specified, TiMidity++ plays in trial pure intona-
              tion.

              -Zpure[n(m)], --pure-intonation=[n(m)]
                     Play in trial pure intonation by Key Signature meta-event
                     in the MIDI file.  You can specify the initial keysig  by
                     hand,  in  case  the  MIDI  file  does  not  contains the
                     meta-event.  Optionally, n is the number  of  key  signa-
                     ture.  In case of sharp, n is positive.  In case of flat,
                     n is negative.  Valid values of n  are  in  the  interval
                     from  -7 to 7.  In case of minor mode, you should put `m'
                     character along with -Zpure option.

       --module=n
              Simulate behavior of specific synthesizer module as much as pos-
              sible.  For the moment, the value of n defined is as follows:
