How to use
-------------
Start typing on any key, and listen to the music.
For example, pressing zxcvb should start a major scale.
(If you don't hear anything, make sure you have a midi out device, your speakers are on, and that under your volume settings, "Synth" is turned up).

Press "Record new layer" to start recording. The music you record will be layered on top of what you've already recorded.
If you made a mistake and want to delete the last layer, click "Undo last recording".
Use File->new to start over entirely.
