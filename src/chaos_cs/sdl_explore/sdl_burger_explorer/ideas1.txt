And simple dialogs...

turn on/off the menagerie view.
generate the menagerie in real time??? That'd be possible. cool in fact.
and blit it every time (can be turned on/off)
can scroll? no, just have it Ctrl-click to zoom in, Shift-click to zoom out
sliding/breathing is something it could launch. (by running itself with different params)


Ctrl-scrollwheel to zoom the view

for windows, use these c# stuff
for linux, just edit the text files.

Generate a random color while the right mouse button is depressed. Keeping the mouse down will cause the colors to cycle. MOUSE-LEFT-P returns T when the right mouse button is depressed.

       (when (sdl:mouse-left-p)
         (setf *random-color* (sdl:color :r (random 255) :g (random 255) :b (random 255))))

if mousedown
