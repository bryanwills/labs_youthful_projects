Things I thought about
-------------

Saving the results of computations, so that zooming in could be
	25% faster, by using the cached results.
	I don't think the added complexity is worth it at this point.


Coming up with a good color scheme.
	Black to white is good because there is a clear 'direction' to it,
	however, one can miss details, because of limited range.
	rainbow covers much range, so details apparent, but no clear 'direction'
		viewer: is green > red? not intuitive
	see the published paper: "rainbow color map considered harmful"

	I used for a time, black, to white, to blue.
	However, between white and blue, the B channel remains constant.
	The most effective transitions have all R,G,B channels changing.

Name the parameters. a script can refer to "lightness" instead of "c3"

Antialias?

The first general bitmap idea was a c# program that interacted with c++ sdl, through messages
