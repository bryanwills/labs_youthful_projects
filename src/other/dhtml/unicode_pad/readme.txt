Requires Python 2.5, Windows XP (linux is not yet supported)

This program is a lightweight text editor intended for writing text in other languages. Most word processors have a "Insert Symbol" option for inserting a foreign character, but this process is too slow. If you do all of your typing in another language, one can set the system language, but this will be a system-wide change and is not very customizable. In this program, on the other hand, it is simple to set up your own keyboard bindings and choose what keys create which characters.

One can also see these bindings shown visually (Characters menu -> Visualize Bindings).

The program begins in Normal Mode, but you can press Control+L to enter Grave Accent mode. In this mode, typing a vowel like o will produce o with a grave accent. Press Control+Space to return to Normal mode. View the available modes for the current keymap by choosing List Modes from the Characters menu.

Edit the current keymap by choosing "Edit key bindings" from the Characters menu. (Changes take effect when the mode is chosen again from the Characters menu). Create a new map by creating a .py.js file in the keymaps directory.
