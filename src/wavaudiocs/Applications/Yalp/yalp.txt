Fun with Audio

Features:
	Record your voice - or anything - and play it at various speeds
	Reverse it, mix it, warp it. *Without* having any experience editing audio.
	Play a song - with your sound effect as the instrument
	Write a list of notes (a b c) and play your own song
	Combine several of these "songs" into a cacaphonus masterpiece


Concepts:
Encourage Creativity
	Experimentation!
	It should be designed so that a user can just start clicking stuff, fun stuff will happen, and 
	The user should not have to know what they are doing.
	Stimulate thinking of how to specify notes to make a tune.


Simple, organic interface
	-It's a toy, make it fun
	-Shouldn't have menus/lists/boring stuff
	-Visual
	






Notes:
	The XOs have mics, which is cool.
	I have written much of the audio-processing code. It just needs a good interface.
	It is currently written in Python. If necessary, the core engine can be written as an extension in C.
	Collaboration and/or sending sounds to friends? (Think about this later)
