This is a Doppler effect simulation, in order to create the sound of particles whizzing past you, in stereo. You, the "observer", are represented by the L and R rectangles. The green numbers represent points along the path of that the particle travels. One specifies the path by moving the position of the numbers, using the mouse. If your points are spread apart, the particle travels faster, and if the points are close, the particle moves slower.
