Generating Images
------------------
Edit final.py to put it in 'show' mode
It uses vpython to show/animate the double pendulum
Use Wink (screencast recorder) to record animation.
Export the Wink recording as HTML, so that images saved as pngs.
Use VirtualDub to create .avi


Generating Audio
-----------------
Edit final.py to put it in 'calc' mode
this generates a 20Mb csv file
Run final-makepseudoaudio.baud to turn into a 'pseudoaudio.wav' file
Run final-Scrubdj.baud on Media/loop/drumloop.wav (728,356 bytes)
the resulting audio is the output



Combining
------------------
change the framerate in virtual dub so that the video is in sync.
virtual dub lets you select a wav file as a soundtrack.

helpful tip: 
to compress video often frame dimensions must be multiple of 4or8.
in virtualdub, apply a 'null transform' filter, with different output size, to crop.

interpret_as_samples
-------------
basically speeding up pseudoaudio.wav a lot.
change the script so that it produces a lot more data.
make a pseudoaudio that will be very long.
use audacity to speed it up significantly.
apply a filter to clean up sound, see interpret_as_samples\*
