Laser Sounds


It's another real-time audio experiment, this one even less serious. Click the 'play' button and drag the dot across the screen
to make "laser sounds".

Try it! (in a recent version of Firefox).

An example - but there are other sounds to be made that I haven't discovered yet.

Moving left to right will increase frequency, moving downwards will increase harmonic content. Moving slowly to the left
with a square wave can make 90s arcade-game like noises. Increase the 'sparkle' to create even older-sounding arcade game
noises.

What's going on? I am playing one tone and quickly changing the frequency. When the frequency is changed slowly, one hears
a typical siren like one would expect. If the frequency is changed more quickly, the result is a "tshu" pulse sound. Finally, if the frequency is
changed very quickly, the entire quality of the sound can change. This is called FM synthesis, where FM stands for frequency modulation. Radio transmitters
use Frequency Modulation, changing the pitch of a single note very quickly, to 'move' a signal in frequency to a very high frequency.
Video games in the 90s also used FM synthesis; when putting this program in square wave mode and moving to the left, the sound resembles
that of a DOS game or GameBoy handheld. Maybe I'll follow the work of some musicians (Bibio, Crystal Castles) in incorporating arcade-like noises into music.

Beat Circles


Make beats. Tweak them by shifting each channel. Save and send to friends.

My novel layout shows the repeating loop as an actual circular loop.

If you have Firefox, try it.

If you don't have Firefox, it looks a bit like this:

Some demo beats I put together (but you really should come up with your own):

Hit the eye icon for another demo.
Because the sound is generated in real time, you can edit the rhythm, and even tempo, during playback.
If the volume of a channel is very high, I 'distort' the sample by intentionally causing clipping. Use the buttons on the left
for more adjustments. The button with dots can change the number of divisions, so that you can make the 7/4 beat you always wanted.
The moving-rectangle button is a useful shortcut: after it is clicked, when you create a drum-hit in the upper-right quadrant, the corresponding 
drum-hit is also turned on in the other three quadrants.
I made this for fun. My actual software is more complicated.

Here is another real-time audio experiment. Some recent electronic music has incorporated 


ben's goodies: 3.92Gb
ben's org 2.46gb
ben's pictures: 4.33 (or less)
pydev 2.23
=12.94. so cool, a 16gb disk should work nicely
