### CellRename -- rename files with spreadsheet UI

* it's faster to type new filenames when layed out in a grid of cells
* rename based on patterns, or append numbers like 001, 002, etc
* add a prefix / suffix
* search/replace within filenames
* regex search/replace within filenames
* if the clipboard contains a file path, cellrename will automatically start in that directory

Tip of the day: You can use the arrow keys to move from cell to cell, and you can press Enter to quickly move down to the next cell.
