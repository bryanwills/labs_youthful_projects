## Join

Here is how to join some audio or video files losslessly,

* Open CsDownloadVid, click Start, and click "Join the pieces of a video or a song"

* Click "Choose...", and select two or more audio files to be joined together, one after the other

* Confirm that the order looks right, you can edit the text in the list to correct the order if needed

* Click "Join Together (lossless)"

* That's it! A .m4a output file will appear alongside the input files

Other formats will also work, such as .flac, .wav, .mp3. In some cases .mp4 videos can be joined, if the same encoding settings were used.
