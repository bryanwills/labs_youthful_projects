## Add soundtrack to a video (lossless)

* Open CsDownloadVid, click Start, click "Separate audio and video"

* Click the button that says "Combine Audio+Video Channel (lossless)"

* Choose an audio file (typically .m4a, .mp4, or .mp3) 

* Choose a video file (typically .mp4, .m4v, or .mkv) 

* That's it! You'll now see an output file alongside the video file.

(Interestingly, the mp4 format doesn't support some common audio types, like flac. The mkv format seems to support many more encodings.)
